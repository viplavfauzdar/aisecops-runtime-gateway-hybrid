This is a Spring Boot service skeleton.

## Note about Gradle wrapper
This starter skeleton includes `gradle-wrapper.properties` but not the wrapper JAR.
If you want fully self-contained builds, run this once locally (with Gradle installed):
```bash
gradle wrapper
```
Then commit the generated `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, and `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`.
